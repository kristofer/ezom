# ezom
EZOM - and Agon Light implementation of the SOM (simple object machine) language system. It's very smalltalk-like, but simpler.

I will use Claude, claude code, and Github copilot to work thru this.

this is about the 7th time I've played with SOM in some way with AI-assist.
most of them have crashed and burned at some level of complexity.
